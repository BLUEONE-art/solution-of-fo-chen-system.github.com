The fractional-order hyperchaotic Chen system can be equivalent to a fourth order system of fractional differential equations. There are many solutions for fractional order equations. In this paper, we give the solution process of Adomian decomposition algorithm in detail. Specific code can refer to our .m file.
We are happy to share our research results. It is hoped that researchers interested in this field can make progress with us and design more efficient and safer algorithms.
